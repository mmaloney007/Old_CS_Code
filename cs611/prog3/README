This directory contains the as611 system.

as611 is a simple assemble-and-execute environment for Alpha
programs.

To build as611: copy all the files in this directory to
a clean directory and type "make".

To run as611: as611 file.s

as611 supports the instructions described in the "Alpha subset"
document, available from the assignment webpage.

as611 does not support any of the standard Alpha assembler directives.

as611 does support some as611-specific directives:

    1. !exec: execute the code assembled so far. location 0 is
              assumed to contain an Alpha function. This will only
              work when run on an Alpha processor.

    2. !dump: dump the code assembled so far.

as611 does support Alpha-style comments (# comment....).

Only a stub is being distributed for assemble.c. Object files are
being distributed for this file for Alpha and Linux machines.

This directory contains some test Alpha assembler inputs for as611.
In particular, see fact.s which computes factorial(10).
