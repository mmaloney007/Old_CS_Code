This is a more-difficult file, in that
it has "special characters" in the file.
It also HAS ---some--- non-words which
contain digits, such as x123 abc1de2xx 
123bd, z1, and 214532yy111 - If a sequence of letters and digits
exist (without special symbols separating the
digits from the letters), then the sequence
does not form a word.  Multiple hyphens,
how-ev-er, are OK, as long as there are letters
between them.  Hyphens also ** can ** break the
sequence between alphas and digits, as in
the word ant-number-23 and 123-go!  In fact,
any special symbol will break 1*one+3 sequence.
